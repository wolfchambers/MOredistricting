With the closure of rural post offices, disastrous flooding, bankrupt mom and pop grocery stores, and the closure of smaller schools, the population of Saline County has been forced to migrate toward Marshall. This has left Marshall with limited quality house, minimal high-paying jobs, and a struggling educational system.

The second type of community (green) are those towns like Slater, Sweet Springs, Malta Bend, Arrow Rock that are struggling to survive. These are towns that without state intervention will no longer exist in 20-30 years because businesses will not be able to sustain themselves, especially with increased population and job loss. 

The third type of community (yellow) are the remote rural areas. These are mostly generational family farms--many of which are routinely flooded out, especially in north Saline County where the MO River ruins fields, towns, bridges, and roads all the same. Southern Saline is routinely flooded out because of the Blackwater River, Salt Fork, and the Lamine.

1834,Healthcare Access (Fitzgibbon/Saline),coi,,https://districtr.org/COI/31900,Lindsey,Simmons,Marshall,,Wed Jul 28 2021 00:01:51 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),"mrcc,healthcare,saline",,"With the recent closure of Pinnacle Health in Boonville, Fitzgibbon Hospital in Marshall, MO became one of the only full-service surgical hospitals in Mid-Missouri. Fitzgibbon routinely treats patients from 7 surrounding counties. Fitzgibbon has one of the only cancer treatment centers, ambulatory care units and active OB/GYN beds for pregnant women in mid-Missouri. Residents living in north Pettis county--particularly those closest to Marshall Junction (I-70 and 65) frequent Fitzgibbon over Bothwell. With the closure of Booneville's hospital, patients from Cooper and Howard Counties now frequent Fitzgibbon more regularly--Fitzgibbon even has a clinic in Fayette. North of Marshall, there are far fewer options, which attracts patients from Chariton and Carroll Counties.

The difficulty for patients living within the green zone is the 20-50 miles some of them must travel to reach their nearest hospital. Poor infrastructure, such as bad roads and bridges limits their ability to reach the hospital. Many seniors live in the most remote rural areas and are not able to make routine visits to the doctor--and when an ambulance is called it can take half an hour or more for it or a firetruck to arrive. Moreover, the lack of internet makes rural telehealth visits nearly impossible. ",

It has four public elementary schools that feed into one public middle school and one public high school. It has one private Catholic school that teaches PK-8 that also feeds into one public high school. The only other high schools in the county are in Slater, Sweet Springs, and Malta Bend. However, there are numerous K-8 schools in many of the smaller communities across the county. The vast majority of those students all have the option of attending Marshall for high school--and most of them make that choice. This results in students living 20-30 miles away from school requiring transportation to and from Marshall. With recent budget cuts to school transportation, a bus driver hiring shortage, and increased infrastructure problems due to tremendous flooding in the area--such as highways being impassable and bridges perpetually under-construction (literally last summer you had to drive around Blackwater, Nelson, Arrow Rock to Slater to get into Marshall which took more than an hour for a trip that should have been 20 minutes). 

Add to those transportation difficulties the fact that most locations outside of Marshall, Slater and Sweet Springs have no option for internet other than unreliable satellite internet and you see that students in the most remote rural communities do not have access to the resources they need to succeed.

Many of the apt. buildings on Armour Blvd were 100% Section 8 until Mac Properties started turning them into market rate apartments probably less than 10 years ago, and only two 100% Section 8 buildings remain.  Mac is building 3 new apt. buildings on Armour (also market rate), and there is already not enough off-street parking.  Although a nursing home and a group home for people with developmental disabilities have been returned to large single family homes in the last several years, there are still houses and buildings that serve as transitional housing for people in substance abuse recovery, families experiencing homelessness, and people with mental health concerns.  There are 3 liberal mainline Protestant Churches, two of which provide office space for worker's rights nonprofit organizations, and all three provide services to low income people in the community and also welcome people who identify as LGBT.  Al-Inshirah Islamic Center is in this community.  Kansas City Public Schools are improving, but that's not well known, and charter and private schools still draw students away from KCPS.  Academie Lafayette French Immersion Charter School and Notre Dame de Sion Lower School are in the community.  The Nelson Atkins Museum of Art is in the generally affluent Rockhill neighborhood.  Houses in North and South Hyde Park and Southmoreland seem to be increasingly owner-occupied and more families with young children seem to be living in the neighborhoods.  Although housing prices are going up, homes in the area are still significantly less expensive than parts of Kansas City to the southwest.  60% of housing is renter-occupied.   2% of resdients have identified as Asian, 3% as more than one race, 8% as Hispanic, 30% as black, and 57% as white. Median income is  about $50,000.  Residents generally support expanding access to health care and the rights of workers, women, people with disabilities, and members of ethnic and racial minority groups.  LGBT homeowners and immigrants have been welcome in the community for decades. The community is located on the historically white side of the (artificially created) dividing line between black and white Kansas City--Troost Avenue, but the divide is being broken down.  ",
